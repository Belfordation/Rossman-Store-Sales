# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting 

 **Goal:** 

- Explore the data (handle missing values etc).
- Analysis per store type and correlational analysis of stores activity.
- Perform extensive Time Series Analysis (seasonal decomposition, trends, autocorrelation).
- Predict next 6 weeks of sales using Prophet (Facebook methodology).

This notebook mainly focuses on the *Time Series Analysis*. An important topic yet not covered. I use then *new methodology Prophet*, recently introduced by *Facebook,* to predict next 6 week of sales. This methodology has a cool feature of modeling for holidays. Finally, right at the end, I also discuss*advantages and drawbacks of forecasting with Seasonal ARIMA and Prophet.*

As it usually goes, we start with the Exploratory Data Analysis of the main metrics revealing present trends and patterns in the data, giving a solid foundation for the further (causal) analysis.
